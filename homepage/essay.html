    <h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>
    <h2>An Analysis by Maureen Soelaiman</h2>
    <p id ="one"> F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby provides commentary on the lives of the ultra-wealthy and the self-absorption that prevails above morality. The dwellers of the East Egg are self-absorbed and apathetic to the struggles of others, yet they’re so fiscally successful that it’s a struggle to not strive to become them, which is the dilemma Nick Carraway is faced with throughout the novel. Fitzgerald uses the relationship between characters Nick and Jordan to display Nick’s complex position within the East Egg. Though Nick is a part of the circle of ultra-wealthy through association, his internal monologue reveals his displacement among within them. Nick’s progressing relationship with Jordan represents his shifting relationship to old money; the way he interacts with her at different points in the novel shows his position within the East Egg.</p>
    <p id="two">Nick Carraway is a relative of Daisy’s, someone aligned with the East but not fully submerged into it. They don’t care about his opinions or his desires: “...he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car” (24). Nick is dragged along with the other characters out of routine and only by association. If he weren’t related to Daisy, he would never be part of this elite circle because his status isn’t on par with theirs. He lives across the river from them but the river is a physical and symbolic representation of their separation in the types of lives they’re leading. Gatsby later realizes this while speaking of the green light on Daisy’s dock and his newfound proximity to her, “Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her…” (93). Additionally, he separates himself mentally when he says, “I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life” (35). Ultimately, Nick is aware that this lifestyle is a facade that’s held in the moment, something fleeting and unsustainable which is what keeps him at odds with them. At this point in the novel, Nick and Jordan are mere acquaintances, allies in some sort because of their mutual association to the East Egg. At Gatsby’s party he finds it “necessary to attach” himself to someone, and that someone was Jordan but only through cordiality were they tied to one another (42). The two held no personal connection and were essentially strangers, leaving Nick an outsider judgmentally looking inwards on the opulent lifestyle of the East and its people.

 <p id ="three">As the novel progresses, Nick falls into a deeper relationship with Jordan and simultaneously, with the East Egg. Though he prides himself as honest, he has no complaints of Jordan who is “incurably dishonest” going as far to say it makes “no difference” to him (58). As he opens himself up to Jordan he becomes more complicit to the whims of the lifestyle he looked upon so scornfully in the past, making exceptions and not sticking to his original disposition. So as he “drew her up again closer” he was not only finding comfort in Jordan, but also bringing himself closer to her luxurious standard of living full of forced pleasantries and in her case, lies (80). When Gatsby makes a request of Nick through Jordan, he gives in without qualms and says, “I’m going to call up Daisy to-morrow and invite her over here to tea” when previously he would’ve groaned at the thought of something unnecessary being asked of him (82). Nick still tries separating himself from the populace of the East Egg: “I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known” but the more time he spends with Jordan becoming attached to the East, this line becomes blurred as now, he’s assimilating to his environment instead of criticizing it (59). Nick can no longer be relied on as an objective perspective to this lavish lifestyle because now he actively holds a position within it.

 <p id= "four"> At the climax of the novel, when Tom’s mistress Myrtle is run over by Daisy, the character’s true colors come out. Though they’re all witness to a series of disturbing events, none of them are phased in the slightest, with the exception of Nick. When they reconvene at Tom and Daisy’s house and Jordan invites Nick inside, he rejects her offer and we learn that he’s “had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too” (142). Jordan is “wrapped in almost impenetrable narcissism” conversely to Nick, who “having watched Gatsby's love for Daisy effectively terminated, having seen Myrtle violently run down, and wrapped in his own loneliness, cannot accede to compulsive and indeed perverse socializing” (Lathbury). It’s at this moment that the facade starts to fall for Nick, as their self-centered responses to such traumatic events disgusts him. He no longer understands how they can stay so unaffected by problems that they’ve created. When he speaks to Gatsby the next day, he reassures him by saying, “They’re a rotten crowd...you’re worth the whole damn bunch put together” referring to the clique of the East Egg (154). His view of them has significantly shifted from a craving to be them, to a strong distaste and shame for once having been a part of them. The final nail in the coffin is Gatsby’s death, which Nick is the only one present for: “After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me…” (176). He wants to leave the East and go back to his home in the Midwest but before doing so he breaks things off with Jordan, who he was “half in love” with for good (177). This split with Jordan is the finale, as it signifies his separation from the East for good, as well as the connections he’s made. He leaves the East Egg the same way he entered, as a judgemental onlooker but contrary to himself in the beginning of the novel, he finds no value in their circle any longer.
</p>
<p id= "five">The progression of Nick’s relationship to Jordan parallels his relation to the East Egg as a whole. As Nick becomes more involved with Jordan romantically, he assimilates into the environment of the East Egg but as their relationship comes to a close, ends up cutting ties with it. At the beginning of the novel Nick starts off as a bystander and transitions into an active member within the circle of the elite, by the end he’s come full circle and is leaving as a bystander to all the damage that’s spawned from the aftermath of their actions.
