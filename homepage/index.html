          <h3>About the story:</h3>
          <p id ="six"> The Great Gatsby is a novel set during the 1920s on Long Island, new York. The novel provides commentary on the American Dream as well as the social climate of the time. America was nearing the end of the Jazz Age and economic boom, leading into the Great Depression. It represented an era of change for America, establishing itself as a world power. The book's main characters are a clique of the ultra-wealthy and many of its themes center around the detached, privileged lifestyles these characters lead as a result of their wealth. The novel's main characters are Nick Carraway (our narrator), along with his estranged cousin Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan, mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby, and Daisy's close friend (and Nick's eventual girlfriend) Jordan Baker. The plot follows a series of twists to uncover the real identity of Gatsby, who is known only for throwing lavish parties at his estate on the water and the various rumors that follow him.</p>
          <h3>The assignment:</h3>
          <p id="seven"> In AP Literature we read the novel and were tasked with writing a paper analyzing the themes present throughout. The characters I wanted to focus on were Nick and Jordan because despite the novel being told from Nick's perspective, we hardly get to know about what's happening to him as a character. His relationship is barely touched upon though it's one of the few pieces of information we get about Nick himself. I wrote about the parallel of Nick's relationsip with Jordan to his view of the East Egg, the elite community his cousin Daisy was apart of and many dreamed of partaking in. I really enjoyed writing this paper and dissecting their relationship because the lack of information given about both characters really intrigued me. Also their relationship seemingly came out of nowhere, it was abrupt for the readers because there was no prior indication of something between them. All aspects of this relationship were interesting which is why I was eager to write about it's impact on the novel as a whole, and on Nick's character.</p>
