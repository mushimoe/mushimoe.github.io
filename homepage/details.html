          <h3>Aesthetic Choices:</h3>
          <p id=six> The images I chose are supposed to convey the atmosphere of Gatsby's parties in the book. Their lifestyles are glamorous and excessive, allowing them to live in an ignorant bubble. The actions of the characters are heavily influenced by their wealth, they have virtually no consequences to their actions and a lot of the plot occurs because despite having everything they need, there's an emptiness to their lives. Thus, I chose photos that convey luxury and grandeur, and a bit of chaos as Gatby's parties were untraditional and open to everyone, regardless of having an invite or not.</p>
          <h3>Movie Adaptations:</h3>
          <p id=six>In 2013 there was a movie adaptation of the novel starring Leondardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, and more. This wasn't the first film adaptation, there are many other earlier versions but this is one of the more well-known. The 2013 film won an Academy Award for Best Production Design, as well as several other awards mainly in the prdocution and design categories. The first film adaptation came out in 1949 and was less accurate to the novel itself. It took creative liberties and focused more on the criminal activities that Gatsby committed, as well as made Jordan a more involved character. There was then a 1974 adaptation more accurate to the book's plot, but not entirely capturing the tone of the novel. The 2000 film was next and starred Paul Rudd, this time the film was significantly shorter than it's previous ones. The 2013 version is the most well known but also deviated from the original plot on some aspects, such as making Nick an alcoholic looking back on his summer. Many agree that the 2013 version has the best character embodiments out of all the movie attempts. </p>
